"""
    The Paillier Experiment - Display
    ~~~~~~~~~
    This module works like a meter display, by querying the blockchain
    ledger and retriving consumption information. He can be seen as a
    client application.

    We assume that this module have access to the meter's Paillier
    private key. That is necessary to decrypt the encrypted measurement
    information.

    Although we are invoking the getConsumption chaincode, such call works
    as a query, since it does not modify the meter asset state.
