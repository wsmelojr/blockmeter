"""
    The Paillier Experiment - Benchmark chaincode_invoke
    ~~~~~~~~~
    PLEASE DONT TRY TO EXECUTE THIS FILE, IT IS USELESS!
    This file is used only to keep a copy of a modified version of the
    chaincode_invoke(...) function implemented by the Fabric Python SDK.

    The original chaincode_invoke(...) implements the standard chaincode
    execution, which means:
        1) Sends the transaction to one or more endorser peers and wait;
        2) Check the endorsement envelop;
        3) Broadcasts the transaction (with the endorsement) to the orderer.

    Additionaly, the original chaincode_invoke(...) also waits for the transaction
    commit. If the commit does not happen before the timeout, it notifies the
    caller to submit the transaction again. This step is not part of the
    standard Fabric protocol. Apparently the Fabric Python SDK community decide
    to implement at this manner by trying to give to the caller a feedback about
    the chaincode execution success (or not).

    You will need the modify version of the chaincode_invoke(...) function to 
    run the client-morph-mp.py program in a proper manner. So you must do the 
    following:

        1) Find the file client.py in your Fabric Python SDK installation. In my
        machine, this file is in:
        /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/hfc-0.7.0-py3.6.egg/hfc/fabric/client.py.

        2) Find the chaincode_invoke(...) function and replace its code by the code
        provided below.
    
    An important detail: We are working with the Fabric Python SDK version 0.7.0. If you
    are using a newer version, maybe it will be necessary to compare both codes a make
    some adaptations.
