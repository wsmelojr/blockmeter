"""
    The Paillier Experiment - Client (simple)
    ~~~~~~~~~
    This module as a single thread client that collect measurements
    from the OPCUA server and inserts encrypted measurements. 
    It does that continually, and the developer can choose between 
    a fix sleep time or a keypress from the user to continue 
    generating measurements.
