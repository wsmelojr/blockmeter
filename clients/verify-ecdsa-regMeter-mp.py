"""
    The BlockMeter Experiment
    ~~~~~~~~~
    This module is part of the multiprocessing client test. It prepare the test
    by registering 100 unique meter IDs for each individual thread. For instance,
    run the benchmark with 10 processes and 10 threads, this bechmark will create
    10*10*100 = 10000 unique IDs. We need to prevent our concurrent
    transactions creates key collision (to learn more about this, we recommend the
    following text:
