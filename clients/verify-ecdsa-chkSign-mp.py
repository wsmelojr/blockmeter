"""
    The BlockMeter Experiment
    ~~~~~~~~~
    This module is a modifying in the multithread client that enables multi processes.
    The advantage in using multi processes is that it enables a better using of
    the CPUs multicores. We can create a big load of simultaneous transactions,
    something that is absolutely necessary in performance tests.


    The module must be executed only after the verify-ecdsa-regMeter-mp.py. Also, the informed
    parameter must be the same in both modules. Basically, the verify-ecdsa-regMeter-mp.py
    registers of all the meter IDs that will be used by the multiprocess client.
    We are generating random messages.

    One should notice that we change the business logic in the manner how we invoke the
    chaincode. Once we have too many concurrent threads, we need to reduce the probability
    of key collision. It happens when consecutive transactions try to change the status of
    the same digital asset. We try to avoid this problem by creating a range of 100
    different meter IDs for each thread. When the thread is started, it receives a
    meter_id base number and a free range of 100 consecutive numbers. So the thread can
    increment the meter_id base into this range, preventing consecutive transactions with
    the same key.
