"""
    The Paillier Experiment - Multithread Client
    ~~~~~~~~~
    This module implements a multithread client that produces
    a load of transactions against a Fabric endorser peer.
    You can use it to execute the following test cases:
        1) Endorser performance test with different Paillier
        key sizes;
        2) Endorser performance test comparing the same chaincode
        business rules using plaintext measurements OR homomorphic
        computing.

        it sends a encrypted measurement by invoking insertMeasurement chaincode.

        chaincode. On it transaction, it collects start and end times, logging them in the
        statistics vector.

        Notice that the Fabric chaincode invoke performs a transcation in two steps.
        First, the transaction is sent to a endorser peer. That call blocks the client
        (i.e., the client waits by the endorser response until the default timeout).
        After, the client sends the endorsed transaction to the orderer service, but do not
        wait by a response anymore. All these steps are encapsulated by the Fabric SDK.
